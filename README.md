# Weather_Analysis_Challenge
## Overview
While developing the PlanMyTrip App, Jack and other beta testers asked for increased functionality with the way the app behaves. To that end, code was developed incorporating different API requests to overlap weather preferences, latitudes and longitudes, google maps, and google directions for those wishing to incorporate driving while they travel.
## Outcome
The tasks listed above were completed and can be found in the accompanying documents. All issues were overcome and the beta test was successful. The end result was a list of Hotels, identified by latitude and longitudes, tied together with weather measurements and overlaid on google maps.
